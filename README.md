# MuseScore 3.3+ plugins

Plugins mainly targeted towards streamlining the realistic playback experience in MuseScore (imagine having to manually increase the tempo of thousands of rubato markings by 2 each, or trying to increase the offset velocity of a bunch of notes all with different velocities by 5).

Install by simply downloading the code from here and copying the .qml file into the MuseScore plugins folder (C:\Program Files\MuseScore [version]\plugins if on Windows).

## BulkVelocityChange
Change velocities of notes in bulk. Useful for when notes have different velocities and it's inconvenient to add 10 (for example) to each note individually in the inspector. Sounds niche and it probably is, but I've wanted this for so long that I finally decided to make it myself.

## BulkDynamicsVelocityChange
Change velocities of dynamics in bulk. Useful for when notes have different velocities and it's inconvenient to add 10 (for example) to each note individually in the inspector. Sounds niche and it probably is, but I've wanted this for so long that I finally decided to make it myself.

## ElementCounter
Just a cool niche thing to count how many elements you've selected, when you want to feel like you did something.
